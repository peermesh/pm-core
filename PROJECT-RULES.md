# PROJECT-RULES.md

> **This file contains project-specific rules and configuration.**
> Universal agent rules are in `AGENTS.md` (immutable global copy).

## Quick Decision Guide (AGENTS.md vs PROJECT-RULES.md)

1. `AGENTS.md` = universal rules (immutable, identical across projects).
2. `PROJECT-RULES.md` = this project's configuration and conventions.
3. Modes: keep a short stub in `AGENTS.md`, put full workflow in an external mode file.
4. Project identity (name/description) lives in `PROJECT-RULES.md`.
5. Build/test/dev commands live in `PROJECT-RULES.md`.
6. Repo structure and module boundaries live in `PROJECT-RULES.md`.
7. Coding style and testing expectations live in `PROJECT-RULES.md`.
8. Infra rules (ports, daemons, services) live in `PROJECT-RULES.md`.
9. Discovered patterns, quirks, and known issues live in `PROJECT-RULES.md`.
10. If unsure: default to `PROJECT-RULES.md`.

## Project-Specific Infrastructure Rules

[Add infrastructure rules specific to this project here.
Example: critical service rules, daemon management, port assignments.]

## Repository Guidelines

What goes here:
